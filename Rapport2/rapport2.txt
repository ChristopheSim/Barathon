Edit since 1st report :

JSON Acces :
We added another DB to store program data as neo4j is only used to store the useful nodes (places, users & caracteristics) & to compute the answer.
JSON files are used to store all the program data (including sub-classes : menus, foods, drinks, locations, etc).

Strategy :
Question about the relevancy of the strategy design pattern. We kept it as the algorithm always returns a list of Places, but these places are sorted differently.

Class diagram :
Added missing operations to classes

Coding conventions : 
Class names begin with a capital letter.
Class files begin with a capital letter. (Do not compile otherwise.)
Data files are written in lower case with dash-separated words.
